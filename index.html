We will assist these individuals in obtaining appropriate treatment, while providing community support and therapeutic support. For individuals who have recently experienced incarceration, this provides them with a new community and social outlet. By changing their social environment, they are more likely to establish healthy daily rhythms, and will be surrounded by other members who are committed to working towards their own recovery goals
