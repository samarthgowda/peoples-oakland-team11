                      The Peoples Oakland Reentry program is an expansion of our services that addresses the needs of individuals suffering from severe mental illness that are being released from the Allegheny County Jail. We will assist these individuals in obtaining appropriate treatment, while providing community support and therapeutic support. For individuals who have recently experienced incarceration, this provides them with a new community and social outlet. By changing their social environment, they are more likely to establish healthy daily rhythms, and will be surrounded by other members who are committed to working towards their own recovery goals.

        <h5>Alice</h5>
        <p>"I think one of the biggest things Peoples Oakland did was offer me support that wasn’t being offered in other areas of my life. They believed in me, that I had the capability to stay out of the hospital, the capability to work. They supported me while I figured these things out for myself. I have an amount of support that I never had before Peoples Oakland existed."</p>

        <p>"I saw most people as potentially harmful to me because of my PTSD. I always thought people would hurt me or steal from me or say things that were hurtful. I had trouble understanding what people meant by things and I would blow things out of proportion."

        <p>"There’s no place quite like Peoples Oakland! As a social work intern, I felt lucky to be welcomed into their family and meet so many caring people. Within the 4 floors of Peoples, you can find anything you would want from a community mental health center. It’s amazing how much is accomplished by the wonderful staff and the ultra-dedicated and helpful members, when you look at it."</p>

        <p>"I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this Program to Joy's life. She absolutely loved going each day she could and cried when she had to stay home. Joy was very fortunate to live with a loving and supportive host family. Lena Lawson, and her family provided a family for Joy who had lost both her parents in her twenties. But People's Oakland was really Joy's friend and activity support."</p>

        <p>"Peoples Oakland was my first experience as a social worker and I am so thankful that it was. Both star and members alike helped me build a strong foundation as an intern that I have ben able to apply in everything that I’ve done since leaving. Every time I stepped into the building I learned something new."</p>
